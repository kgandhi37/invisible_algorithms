__Some basic functions using JavaScript__

1. Add numbers as strings to allow us to handle large numbers
1. A string function to allow us to find all possible permutations of a string _(further explained in script)_.

Also included are some unit tests using Mocha and Chai (within the test folder). They test the number function.

To install Mocha + Chai please navigate to your working directory on terminal and type:

`npm install mocha chai --save-dev`

The code above will allow you to test in browser.

To run the test, run the testrunner.html file in the test folder after installing Mocha.
